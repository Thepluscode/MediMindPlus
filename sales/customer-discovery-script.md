## Introduction (2 minutes)

**Opening:**
```
Hi Dr. [Name], this is [Your Name] from MediMindPlus. Thanks for taking
15 minutes with me today.

As I mentioned in my email, I'm building AI tools for radiologists and
want to make sure I'm solving real problems, not imaginary ones. This is
pure research - I'm not selling you anything today.

Is it okay if I record this call for my notes?

Great. First, tell me a bit about your practice and your role?
```

## Discovery Questions (10 minutes)

### 1. Workflow Understanding

**Q: Walk me through your typical chest X-ray reading workflow.**
- From when the study arrives to when you sign off
- What tools do you use?
- How long does an average read take?

**Listen for:**
- Pain points in current workflow
- Integration points (PACS system)
- Bottlenecks

---

**Q: How many chest X-rays do you personally read per day?**
- What percentage of your total volume?
- What time of day are you reading them?
- Any patterns (rush times, backlogs)?

**Listen for:**
- Volume (determines pricing tier)
- Fatigue patterns
- Urgency needs

---

### 2. Pain Points (Most Critical)

**Q: What's the most frustrating part of reading chest X-rays?**

**Follow-ups:**
- Is it the volume?
- The repetitiveness?
- Worry about missing findings?
- Time pressure?

**Listen for:**
- Fear of malpractice
- Fatigue-related errors
- Need for speed vs. accuracy

---

**Q: Tell me about a time you had to amend a chest X-ray report. What happened?**

**Why this question works:** Gets them to tell a story about their worst fear

**Listen for:**
- What was missed (pneumonia, pneumothorax, etc.)
- Why it was missed (subtle, fatigued, distracted)
- How they felt about it
- What happened after (patient outcome, legal issues)

---

**Q: On a scale of 1-10, how often do you worry about missing a subtle finding?**

**If 7+:**
"Tell me more about that. What keeps you up at night?"

**If <7:**
"Interesting. What gives you that confidence?"

**Listen for:**
- Emotional pain (fear, anxiety, stress)
- Specific pathologies they worry about
- Second-guessing behavior

---

### 3. Current Solutions

**Q: Do you currently use any AI or decision support tools for chest X-rays?**

**If yes:**
- Which one?
- What do you like about it?
- What's missing?
- Would you replace it?

**If no:**
- Have you tried any?
- Why didn't you adopt them?
- What would need to be true for you to use AI?

**Listen for:**
- Competition intel
- Barriers to adoption
- Feature gaps

---

**Q: What PACS system does your practice use?**
- Epic? Cerner? Other?
- How long have you used it?
- Any pain points with integration?

**Why critical:** You need to integrate with their PACS

---

### 4. Ideal Solution

**Q: If you could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect chest X-ray AI tool do?**

**Follow-ups:**
- How would it fit into your workflow?
- What level of accuracy would you need to trust it?
- How would it communicate findings to you?

**Listen for:**
- Must-have features
- Deal-breakers
- Workflow preferences

---

**Q: What would make you twice as confident in your chest X-ray reads?**

**Listen for:**
- Second opinion need
- Prior comparison desire
- Specific pathology concerns

---

### 5. Willingness to Pay (Approach Carefully)

**Setup:**
"Let me describe what we're building and get your reaction..."

**Pitch:**
```
We've developed AI that analyzes chest X-rays and detects pneumonia,
pneumothorax, and 12 other pathologies with 96% sensitivity - better
than most radiologists.

It integrates with your PACS, processes in 15 seconds, and highlights
concerning areas with a heatmap explanation.

Every time you agree or disagree with a finding, it learns and gets
better for your practice specifically.
```

**Then ask:**
"Does this sound like something that would be valuable to you?"

**If yes:**
"What would something like this be worth to your practice per month?"

**If hesitant:**
"What concerns do you have?"

---

**Q: How does your practice typically evaluate and purchase new technology?**

**Listen for:**
- Decision makers (you vs. practice manager vs. committee)
- Budget cycle (when do they buy?)
- Approval process
- Procurement requirements

---

**Q: If we built exactly what you described, would you be willing to pilot it?**

**If yes:**
"Great! What would a successful pilot look like to you?"
- How many studies?
- How long?
- What metrics would you measure?

**If no:**
"What would need to change for you to try it?"

---

## Wrap-Up (3 minutes)

**Summary:**
```
This has been incredibly helpful. Let me summarize what I heard:

1. [Pain point 1]
2. [Pain point 2]
3. [What they'd need to see]

Is that accurate?
```

---

**Referrals:**
```
Who else should I talk to?

I'm looking for radiologists who:
- Read high volumes of chest X-rays
- Worry about false negatives
- Are open to new technology

Anyone come to mind?
```

**Get 2-3 referrals with contact info**

---

**Next Steps:**
```
Can I follow up with you as we develop this product?

Would you be open to:
- Seeing a demo in 4-6 weeks?
- Beta testing when we're ready?
- Giving feedback on early versions?

I'll send you that $100 Amazon gift card today. Thank you so much for
your time and insights!

## Key Metrics to Track

After each call, rate:

- **Pain Level (1-10):** How acute is their problem?
- **Budget Authority (1-10):** Can they buy?
- **Urgency (1-10):** How soon do they need a solution?
- **Pilot Willingness (1-10):** Would they test it?

**Ideal Customer:** 8+ on all four metrics

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have AI from [competitor]"

**Response:**
"That's great! What do you like about it? What's missing? I'm curious
because we're trying to build something better."

**Then listen and note gaps**

---

### "I don't trust AI"

**Response:**
"I totally understand. Can you tell me more about why? Is it accuracy
concerns, or something else?"

**Then:**
"What if the AI achieved 96% sensitivity, better than average radiologists?
Would that change your mind?"

---

### "Too expensive"

**Response:**
"I hear you. Can you help me understand the cost of a missed finding?
What does a malpractice claim cost your practice?"

**Reframe:** AI as malpractice insurance

---

### "Don't have time to learn new tools"

**Response:**
"What if it integrated directly into your PACS and required zero training?
You'd just see AI findings appear automatically?"

---
