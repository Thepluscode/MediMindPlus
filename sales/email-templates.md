# Email Templates for Radiologist Outreach

## Cold Email Sequence

### Email #1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about chest X-ray workflow

```
Dr. [LastName],

I'm [YourName], founder of MediMindPlus. We're building AI tools for
radiologists, and I'd love 15 minutes of your time to understand your
chest X-ray workflow.

I'm not selling anything - genuinely doing research to understand
radiologist pain points. Happy to send you a $100 Amazon gift card
for your time.

Would you have 15 minutes this week or next?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
[Calendar Link]

P.S. Here's what radiologists at [Similar Practice] told me were their
biggest frustrations: [mention 2-3 pain points from previous calls]
```

**Send:** Monday-Thursday, 8-10am (radiologists check email early)

### Email #2: Follow-up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about chest X-ray workflow

```
Dr. [LastName],

Following up on my email below about chest X-ray AI research.

I know you're busy, so I'll be brief: I'm talking to 50 radiologists
about their biggest workflow frustrations. Takes 15 minutes, and I'll
send you $100 for your time.

Already spoke with radiologists at:
- [Practice 1]
- [Practice 2]
- [Practice 3]

Common themes: worry about false negatives, high volume fatigue, and
integration headaches.

Sound familiar?

15 minutes this week? [Calendar link]

### Email #3: Value-first approach (3 days later)

**Subject:** AI catching pneumonias radiologists miss

```
Dr. [LastName],

Saw this study and thought of you:

"AI detected 30% more pneumonias that radiologists initially missed in
high-volume settings."

We're building similar AI that integrates with [their PACS system] and
provides a second opinion in 15 seconds.

Still happy to send you $100 for 15 minutes of feedback on whether
something like this would be useful to you.

Interested in chatting?

### Email #4: Social proof (3 days later)

**Subject:** How [Similar Practice] is using AI for chest X-rays

```
Dr. [LastName],

Quick update: After talking with 20+ radiologists, here's what I learned:

Top frustration: "I worry about missing subtle pneumonias when reading
100+ studies a day"

Top request: "AI that integrates with my PACS and catches things I
might miss"

Dr. [Reference Name] at [Practice] is piloting our AI this month. Early
results: catching 2-3 findings per week that might have been missed.

Would you have 15 minutes to give me your perspective? Still offering
the $100 gift card.

### Email #5: Break-up email (5 days later)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Dr. [LastName],

I've reached out a few times about AI for chest X-rays. Haven't heard
back, so I assume:

a) Not interested
b) Too busy
c) Emails going to spam

If (c), no problem - just reply "interested" and I'll send my calendar.

If (a) or (b), I'll close your file and won't bother you again.

Either way, thanks for your time.

[Your Name]

P.S. If you know another radiologist who'd be interested in giving
feedback for $100, I'd appreciate the intro.
```

**Note:** Break-up emails often get highest response rates (30%+)

## Referral Request Email

**When:** After great discovery call

**Subject:** Quick favor - who else should I talk to?

```
Dr. [Name],

Thanks again for the fantastic conversation yesterday. Your insights on
[specific pain point] were incredibly valuable.

Quick favor: Who else should I talk to?

I'm looking for radiologists who:
- Read high volumes of chest X-rays
- Worry about false negatives
- Are open to new technology

Anyone at [their hospital/practice] or in your network come to mind?

Happy to send them the same $100 gift card for their time.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

## Objection Handling Email Templates

### "Too expensive"

**Subject:** Re: Pricing - ROI breakdown

```
Dr. [Name],

I understand the pricing concern. Let me break down the ROI:

**Costs:**
- MediMindPlus: $2,999/month = $36K/year

**Benefits:**
- Average malpractice claim: $200K
- Your volume: [X] chest X-rays/year
- Miss rate without AI: 2-3% (industry average)
- Potential misses: [calculated number]

**If MediMindPlus catches just ONE miss per year:**
- Avoided cost: $200K (claim) + $50K (legal) + emotional stress
- ROI: 694% return on investment

**If it catches ZERO misses:**
- Peace of mind reading [X] studies/day: Priceless
- Reduced anxiety about false negatives: [value]

Plus, many practices find their malpractice insurance rates decrease
when they can demonstrate AI-assisted reading.

Worth reconsidering?

### "Need to think about it"

**Subject:** What questions can I answer?

```
Dr. [Name],

Totally understand you need time to think.

What specific questions or concerns can I help address?

- Integration complexity?
- Clinical accuracy data?
- ROI calculations?
- Contract terms?
- Something else?

I'm here to help. What would make this an easier decision?

[Your Name]
```

### "Need to discuss with partners"

**Subject:** Meeting with your partners - can I help?

```
Dr. [Name],

Makes sense you'd want partner buy-in.

Would it help if I:
- Sent you a summary deck to share with them?
- Joined your partner meeting to answer questions?
- Extended the pilot so partners can try it?
- Set up demos for each partner individually?

What would make their decision easier?

[Your Name]

**Pro Tip:** The money is in the follow-up. 80% of sales happen after the 5th touchpoint, but 44% of salespeople give up after the first email.

Be persistent, but polite. You're offering value ($100 gift card + potentially life-saving AI), not spamming.
